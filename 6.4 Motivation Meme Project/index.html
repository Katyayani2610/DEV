  TODO: Create a motivational post website.
Style it how ever you like. 
Look at the goal image for inspiration.
But it must have the following features:
1. The main h1 text should be using the Regular Libre Baskerville Font from Google Fonts:
  https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville
2. The text should be white and background black.
3. Add your own image into the images folder inside assets. It should have a 5px white border.
4. The text should be center aligned.
5. Create a div to contain the h1, p and img elements. Adjust the margins so that the image and text are centered on the page. 
  Hint: You horizontally center a div by giving it a width of 50% and a margin-left of 25%.
  Hint: Set the image to have a width of 100% so it fills the div. 
6. Read about the text-transform property on MDN docs to make the h1 uppercase with CSS.

    <h1> A thousand Boy Kisses</h1>
    <p1>
      A huge smile spread across my lips, and a flood of pure happiness washed
over me. Unable to resist, I crashed my lips to Poppy’s waiting mouth. The
minute I tasted her sweet taste on my lips, a deep peace filled me from within.

    <h1> Opacarophile</h1>
    <p2>If you've ever been captivated by the setting sun's charm, entranced by the shifting hues and stunning play of light, you might just be an opacarophile.
     An opacarophile is someone who finds beauty in sunsets, entranced by the shifting hues that dance across the sky as the day makes way for the night.</p2>

     <h1> Wings Of Fire - APJ Abdul Kalam Autobiography</h1>
     <p3>Wings of Fire (1999), is the autobiography of the Missile Man of India and President of India, Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam. It was written by him and Arun Tiwari.[1]

      In the autobiography, Kalam examines his early life, effort, hardship, fortitude, luck and chance that eventually led him to lead Indian space research, nuclear and missile programs. Kalam started his career, after graduating from Aerospace engineering at Madras Institute of Technology, at Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and was assigned to build a hovercraft prototype. Later he moved to ISRO and helped establish the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre and pioneered the first space launch-vehicle program. During the 1990s and early 2000, Kalam moved to the DRDO to lead the Indian nuclear weapons program, with particular successes in thermonuclear weapons development culminating in the operation Smiling Buddha and an ICBM Agni.</p3>
